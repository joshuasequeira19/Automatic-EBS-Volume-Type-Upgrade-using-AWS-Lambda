# Automatic EBS Volume Type Upgrade using AWS Lambda

This GitHub repository contains code and instructions for automatically upgrading the EBS volume type from `gp2` to `gp3` for newly created volumes using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events.

## Overview

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes are an essential component in AWS for storing data. The `gp2` volume type is a popular choice for general-purpose workloads, but the newer `gp3` volume type offers enhanced performance and cost benefits. This project aims to automate the process of upgrading newly created `gp2` volumes to `gp3` using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events.

## Architecture

The architecture of this solution involves the following components:

1. **CloudWatch Events Rule**: Monitors the AWS environment for any new EBS volume creations.

2. **Lambda Function**: Triggered by the CloudWatch Events rule, this Lambda function is written in Python and performs the following steps:
   - Checks if the newly created volume is of type `gp2`.
   - If the volume is `gp2`, it modifies the volume to be of type `gp3`.

3. **IAM Role**: The Lambda function is associated with an IAM role that has the least privilege permissions required to modify EBS volume types.

## Getting Started

To implement this solution in your AWS environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine or AWS environment.

2. **Configure Lambda Role**: Create an IAM role in AWS that grants the necessary permissions to modify EBS volume types. Attach the policy to the Lambda role.

3. **Deploy Lambda Function**: Use the AWS Lambda service to deploy the provided Python script as a Lambda function. Configure the function to use the IAM role you created in the previous step.

4. **CloudWatch Events**: Create a new CloudWatch Events rule that triggers the Lambda function whenever a new EBS volume is created.

5. **Test the Solution**: Create a new `gp2` EBS volume in your AWS environment. Observe how the CloudWatch Events rule triggers the Lambda function to automatically upgrade the volume type to `gp3`.

## Notes

- This solution focuses on upgrading `gp2` volumes to `gp3` for simplicity. You can modify the Lambda function to accommodate other scenarios as needed.

- Always exercise caution when making changes to production resources. Thoroughly test this solution in a non-production environment before deploying it to critical systems.
